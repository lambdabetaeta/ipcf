@article{Rabin1959,
abstract = {Finite automata are considered in this paper as instruments for classifying finite tapes. Each one-tape automaton defines a set of tapes, a two-tape automaton defines a set of pairs of tapes, et cetera. The structure of the defined sets is studied. Various generalizations of the notion of an automaton are introduced and their relation to the classical automata is determined. Some decision problems concerning automata are shown to be solvable by effective algorithms; others turn out to be unsolvable by algorithms.},

abstract = {The author's forthcoming book proves central results in computability and complexity theory from a programmer-oriented perspective. In addition to giving more natural definitions, proofs and perspectives on classical theorems by Cook, Hartmanis, Savitch, etc., some new results have come from the alternative approach. One: for a computation model more natural than the Turing machine, multiplying the available problem-solving time provably increases problem-solving power (in general not true for Turing machines). Another: the class of decision problems solvable by Wadler's "treeless" programs [8], or by cons-free programs on Lisp-like lists, are identical with the well-studied complexity class LOGSPACE. A third is that cons-free programs augmented with recursion can solve all and only PTIME problems. Paradoxically, these programs often run in exponential time (not a contradiction, since they can be simulated in polynomial time by memoization.) This tradeoff indicates a tension between running time and memory space which seems worth further investigation. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Abramsky2015b,
abstract = {We present a novel coalgebraic formulation of infinite extensive games. We define both the game trees and the strategy profiles by possibly infinite systems of corecursive equations. Certain strategy profiles are proved to be subgame-perfect equilibria using a novel proof principle of predicate coinduction which is shown to be sound. We characterize all subgame-perfect equilibria for the dollar auction game. The economically interesting feature is that in order to prove these results we do not need to rely on continuity assumptions on the pay-offs which amount to discounting the future. In particular, we prove a form of one-deviation principle without any such assumptions. This suggests that coalgebra supports a more adequate treatment of infinite-horizon models in game theory and economics.},

@article{Moggi1991,
abstract = {The $\lambda$-calculus is considered an useful mathematical tool in the study of programming languages, since programs can be identified with $\lambda$-terms. However, if one goes further and uses $\beta$$\eta$-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification is introduced (programs are identified with total functions from values to values), that may jeopardise the applicability of theoretical results. In this paper we introduce calculi based on a categorical semantics for computations, that provide a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs, for a wide range of notions of computation.},

abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a form of reactive pro- gramming whose model is pure functions over signals. FRP is of- ten expressed in terms of arrows with loops, which is the type class for a Freyd category (that is a premonoidal category with a carte- sian centre) equipped with a premonoidal trace. This type system suffices to define the dataflow structure of a reactive program, but does not express its temporal properties. In this paper, we show that Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) is a natural extension of the type system for FRP, which constrains the temporal behaviour of reactive programs. We show that a constructive LTL can be de- fined in a dependently typed functional language, and that reactive programs form proofs of constructive LTL properties. In particular, implication in LTL gives rise to stateless functions on streams, and the “constrains” modality gives rise to causal functions. We show that reactive programs form a partially traced monoidal category, and hence can be given as a form of arrows with loops, where the type system enforces that only decoupled functions can be looped.},

@article{Beklemishev:2014,
abstract = {Provability logic concerns the study of modality $\Box$ as provability in formal systems such as Peano arithmetic. Natural, albeit quite surprising, topological interpretation of provability logic has been found in the 1970's by Harold Simmons and Leo Esakia. They have observed that the dual $\Diamond$ modality, corresponding to consistency in the context of formal arithmetic, has all the basic properties of the topological derivative operator acting on a scattered space. The topic has become a long-term project for the Georgian school of logic led by Esakia, with occasional contributions from elsewhere. More recently, a new impetus came from the study of polymodal provability logic GLP that was known to be Kripke incomplete and, in general, to have a more complicated behavior than its unimodal counterpart. Topological semantics provided a better alternative to Kripke models in the sense that GLP was shown to be topologically complete. At the same time, new fascinating connections with set theory and large cardinals have emerged. We give a survey of the results on topological semantics of provability logic starting from first contributions by Esakia. However, a special emphasis is put on the recent work on topological models of polymodal provability logic. We also included a few results that have not been published so far, most notably the results of Section 6 (due the second author) and Sections 10, 11 (due to the first author).},

Our aim is to understand how it relates to standard one-person arguments, and why the `believes-assumes' modality used in the argument arises. We recast it as a fixpoint result, which can be carried out in any regular category, and show how it can be reduced to a relational form of the one-person diagonal argument due to Lawvere. We give a compositional account, which leads to simple multi-agent generalizations. We also outline a general approach to the construction of assumption complete models.},

These results are proved first in the absence of symmetry in the monoidal structure, and then with this symmetry. In the later parts of the paper the coherence results are extended to monoidal endofunctors in monoidal categories that have diagonal or codiagonal natural transformations, or where the monoidal structure is given by finite products or coproducts. Monoidal endofunctors are interesting because they stand behind monoidal monads and comonads, for which coherence will be proved in a sequel to this paper.},

This coding is the type-erasing coding definable already in the simply typed lambda-calculus using only abstraction on term variables. It is shown that there does not exist any decompiler for System F in System F, where the decompiler maps a term of System F to its code. An internal model of F is given by interpreting each type of F by some type equipped with maps between the type and the code type. This paper gives a decompiler- normalizer for this internal model in F, where the decompiler-normalizer maps any term of the internal model to the code of its normal form. It is also shown that for any model of F the composition of this internal model and the model produces another model of F whose equational theory is below untyped beta-eta-equality. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our main result is that $\lambda$nd has the nice operational properties of the standard lambda calculus: confluence on sets of expressions, and normal order reduction is sufficient to reach head normal form. Using a strong contextual equivalence we show correctness of several program transformations. In particular of lambda-lifting using deterministic maximal free expressions. These results show that $\lambda$nd is a new and also natural combination of non-determinism and lambda-calculus, which has a lot of opportunities for parallel evaluation. An intended application of $\lambda$nd is as a foundation for compiling lazy functional programming languages with I/O based on direct calls. The set of correct program transformations can be rigorously distinguished from non-correct ones. All program transformations are permitted with the slight exception that for transformations like common subexpression elimination and lambda-lifting with maximal free expressions the involved subexpressions have to be deterministic ones. {\textcopyright} 1998 ACM.},

abstract = {We give an introduction to Turing categories, which are a convenient setting for the categorical study of abstract notions of computability. The concept of a Turing category first appeared (albeit not under that name or at the level of generality we present it here) in the work of Longo and Moggi; later, Di Paolo and Heller introduced the closely related recursion categories. One of the purposes of Turing categories is that they may be used to develop categorical formulations of recursion theory, but they also include other notions of computation, such as models of (partial) combinatory logic and of the (partial) lambda calculus. In this paper our aim is to give an introduction to the basic structural theory, while at the same time illustrating how the notion is a meeting point for various other areas of logic and computation. We also provide a detailed exposition of the connection between Turing categories and partial combinatory algebras and show the sense in which the study of Turing categories is equivalent to the study of PCAs. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

@article{Jay2011b,
abstract = {Self-interpreters can be roughly divided into two sorts: self-recognisers that recover the input program from a canonical representation, and self-enactors that execute the input program. Major progress for statically-typed languages was achieved in 2009 by Rendel, Ostermann, and Hofer who presented the first typed self-recogniser that allows representations of different terms to have different types. A key feature of their type system is a type:type rule that renders the kind system of their language inconsistent. In this paper we present the first statically-typed language that not only allows representations of different terms to have different types, and supports a self-recogniser, but also supports a self-enactor. Our language is a factorisation calculus in the style of Jay and Given-Wilson, a combinatory calculus with a factorisation operator that is powerful enough to support the pattern-matching functions necessary for a self-interpreter. This allows us to avoid a type:type rule. Indeed, the types of System F are sufficient. We have implemented our approach and our experiments support the theory.},

@article{Jones2012,
abstract = {From a programming perspective, Alan Turing's epochal 1936 paper on computable functions introduced several new concepts, including what is today known as self-interpreters and programs as data, and invented a great many now-common programming techniques. We begin by reviewing Turing's contribution from a programming perspective; and then systematize and mention some of the many ways that later developments in models of computation (MOCs) have interacted with computability theory and programming language research. Next, we describe the 'blob' MOC: a recent stored-program computational model without pointers. In the blob model, programs are truly first-class citizens, capable of being automatically compiled, or interpreted, or executed directly. Further, the blob model appears closer to being physically realizable than earlier computation models. In part, this is due to strong finiteness owing to early binding in the program; and a strong adjacency property: the active instruction is always adjacent to the piece of data on which it operates. The model is Turing complete in a strong sense: a universal interpretation algorithm exists that is able to run any program in a natural way and without arcane data encodings. Next, some of the best known among the numerous existing MOCs are described, and we develop a list of traits an 'ideal' MOC should possess from our perspective. We make no attempt to consider all models put forth since Turing's 1936 paper, and the selection of models covered concerns only models with discrete, atomic computation steps. The next step is to classify the selected models by qualitative rather than quantitative features. Finally, we describe how the blob model differs from an 'ideal' MOC, and identify some natural next steps to achieve such a model.},

Any object may be treated intensionally (subject only to &alpha;-conversion), extensionally (subject also to &beta;&eta;-conversion), or as irrelevant (equal to any other object at the same type), depending on where it occurs. Modal restrictions developed by R. Harper et al. (2000) for single types are generalized and employed to guarantee consistency between these views of objects. Potential applications are in logical frameworks, functional programming and the foundations of first-order modal logics. Our type theory contrasts with previous approaches that, a priori, distinguished propositions (whose proofs are all identified - only their existence is important) from specifications (whose implementations are subject to some definitional equalities)},

This method may be of use for practicing functional programmers; in addition, it provides further evidence of the power of lazy evaluation. The method itself is straightforward: each term that may raise an exception or backtrack is replaced by a term that returns a list of values. In the special case of pattern matching without backtracking, the method can be applied even if lazy evaluation is not present. The method should be suitable for applications such as theorem proving using tacticals, as in ML/LCF.},

@article{Licata2011,
abstract = {Recent work on higher-dimensional type theory has explored connections between Martin-L??f type theory, higher-dimensional category theory, and homotopy theory. These connections suggest a generalization of dependent type theory to account for computationally relevant proofs of propositional equality-for example, taking IdSet A B to be the isomorphisms between A and B. The crucial observation is that all of the familiar type and term constructors can be equipped with a functorial action that describes how they preserve such proofs. The key benefit of higher-dimensional type theory is that programmers and mathematicians may work up to isomorphism and higher equivalence, such as equivalence of categories. In this paper, we consider a further generalization of higher-dimensional type theory, which associates each type with a directed notion of transformation between its elements. Directed type theory accounts for phenomena not expressible in symmetric higher-dimensional type theory, such as a universe set of sets and functions, and a type Ctx used in functorial abstract syntax. Our formulation requires two main ingredients: First, the types themselves must be reinterpreted to take account of variance; for example, a ?? type is contravariant in its domain, but covariant in its range. Second, whereas in symmetric type theory proofs of equivalence can be internalized using the Martin-L??f identity type, in directed type theory the two-dimensional structure must be made explicit at the judgemental level. We describe a 2-dimensional directed type theory, or 2DTT, which is validated by an interpretation into the strict 2-category Cat of categories, functors, and natural transformations. We also discuss applications of 2DTT for programming with abstract syntax, generalizing the functorial approach to syntax to the dependently typed and mixed-variance case. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.},

Then this model is used as an "abstract object language" into which ALGOL 60 is mapped. Many of ALGOL 60's features emerge as particular arrangements of a small number of structural rules, suggesting new classifications and generalizations.The correspondence is first described informally, mainly by illustrations. The second part of the paper gives a formal descriptions, i.e. an "abstract compiler" into the "abstract object language." This is itself presented in a "purely functional" notation, that is one using only application and abstraction.},

As a corollary, we obtain a syntactic duality result: there exist syntactic translations between call-by-name and call-by-value which are mutually inverse and which preserve the operational semantics.

abstract = {We define a general framework that abstracts the common features of many intuitionistic sub-structural and modal logics / type theories. The framework is a sequent calculus / normal-form type theory parametrized by a mode theory, which is used to describe the structure of contexts and the structural properties they obey. In this sequent calculus, the context itself obeys standard structural properties, while a term, drawn from the mode theory, constrains how the context can be used. Product types, implications, and modalities are defined as instances of two general con-nectives, one positive and one negative, that manipulate these terms. Specific mode theories can express a range of substructural and modal connectives, including non-associative, ordered, linear, affine, relevant, and cartesian products and implications; monoidal and non-monoidal functors, (co)monads and adjunctions; n-linear variables; and bunched implications. We prove cut (and identity) admissibility independently of the mode theory, obtaining it for many different logics at once. Further, we give a general equational theory on derivations / terms that, in addition to the usual $\beta$$\eta$-rules, characterizes when two derivations differ only by the placement of structural rules. Additionally, we give an equivalent semantic presentation of these ideas, in which a mode theory corresponds to a 2-dimensional cartesian multicategory, the framework corresponds to another such multicategory with a functor to the mode theory, and the logical connectives make this into a bifibration. Finally, we show how the framework can be used both to encode existing existing logics / type theories and to design new ones.},

@article{Makkai1996a,
abstract = {The notion of anafunctor is introduced. An anafunctor is, roughly, a "functor defined up to isomorphism". Anafunctors have a general theory paralleling that of ordinary functors; they have natural transformations, they form categories, they can be composed, etc. Anafunctors can be saturated, to ensure that any object isomorphic to a possible value of the anafunctor is also a possible value at the same argument object. The existence of anafunctors in situations when ordinarily one would use choice is ensured without choice; e.g., for a category which has binary products, but not specified binary products, the anaversion of the product functor is canonically definable, unlike the ordinary product functor that needs the axiom of choice. When the composition functors in a bicategory are changed into anafunctors, one obtains anabicategories. In the standard definitions of bicategories such as the monoidal category of modules over a ring, or the bicategory of spans in a category with pullbacks, and many others, one uses choice; the anaversions of these bicategories have canonical definitions. The overall effect is an elimination of the axiom of choice, and of non-canonical choices, in large parts of general category theory. To ensure the Cartesian closed character of the bicategory of small categories, with anafunctors as 1-cells, one uses a weak version of the axiom of choice, which is related to A. Blass' axiom of Small Violations of Choice (1979).},

Probability distributions form a monad, and the monadic definition leads to a simple, natural semantics for a stochastic lambda calculus, as well as simple, clean implementations of common queries. But the monadic implementation of the expectation query can be much less efficient than current best practices in probabilistic modeling. We therefore present a language of measure terms, which can not only denote discrete probability distributions but can also support the best known modeling techniques. We give a translation of stochastic lambda calculus into measure terms. Whether one translates into the probability monad or into measure terms, the results of the translations denote the same probability distribution.},

abstract = {We review the origins of structural operational semantics. The main publication 'A Structural Approach to Operational Semantics,' also known as the 'Aarhus Notes,' appeared in 1981 [G.D. Plotkin, A structural approach to operational semantics, DAIMI FN-19, Computer Science Department, Aarhus University, 1981]. The development of the ideas dates back to the early 1970s, involving many people and building on previous work on programming languages and logic. The former included abstract syntax, the SECD machine, and the abstract interpreting machines of the Vienna school; the latter included the ??-calculus and formal systems. The initial development of structural operational semantics was for simple functional languages, more or less variations of the ??-calculus; after that the ideas were gradually extended to include languages with parallel features, such as Milner's CCS. This experience set the ground for a more systematic exposition, the subject of an invited course of lectures at Aarhus University; some of these appeared in print as the 1981 Notes. We discuss the content of these lectures and some related considerations such as 'small state' versus 'grand state,' structural versus compositional semantics, the influence of the Scott-Strachey approach to denotational semantics, the treatment of recursion and jumps, and static semantics. We next discuss relations with other work and some immediate further development. We conclude with an account of an old, previously unpublished, idea: an alternative, perhaps more readable, graphical presentation of systems of rules for operational semantics. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Capretta's delay monad can be used to model partial computations, but it has the "wrong" notion of built-in equality, strong bisimilarity. An alternative is to quotient the delay monad by the "right" notion of equality, weak bisimilarity. However, recent work by Chapman et al. suggests that it is impossible to define a monad structure on the resulting construction in common forms of type theory without assuming the axiom of countable choice. Using an idea from homotopy type theory -a higher inductive-inductive type- we construct a partiality monad without relying on countable choice. We prove that, in the presence of countable choice, our partiality monad is equivalent to the delay monad quotiented by weak bisimilarity. Finally, we outline several applications.},

abstract = {Lawvere theories and monads have been the two main category theoretic formulations of universal algebra, Lawvere theories arising in 1963 and the connection with monads being established a few years later. Monads, although mathematically the less direct and less malleable formulation, rapidly gained precedence. A generation later, the definition of monad began to appear extensively in theoretical computer science in order to model computational effects, without reference to universal algebra. But since then, the relevance of universal algebra to computational effects has been recognised, leading to renewed prominence of the notion of Lawvere theory, now in a computational setting. This development has formed a major part of Gordon Plotkin's mature work, and we study its history here, in particular asking why Lawvere theories were eclipsed by monads in the 1960's, and how the renewed interest in them in a computer science setting might develop in future. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper is a collection of remarks on control categories, including answers to some frequently asked questions. The paper is not self-contained and must be read in conjunction with [3]. We clarify the definition of response categories, and show that most of the conditions can be dropped. In particular, the requirement of having finite sums can be dropped, leading to an interesting new CPS translation of the $\lambda$µ-calculus. We discuss the choice of left-to-right vs. right-to-left evaluation in the call-by-value lambda calculus, an issue which is sometimes misunderstood because it is a purely syntactical issue which is not reflected semantically. We clarify the relationships between various alternative formulations of disjunction types and conjunction types, which coincide in call-by-value but differ in call-by-name. We prove that copyable and discardable maps are not always central, and we characterize those control categories of the form R Set for which copyable and discardable implies central. We prove that any control category with initial object is a preorder.},

abstract = {Constructive versions of modal logic are developed in which the possibility and necessity operators are not interdeﬁnable. The logics do not stem from philosophical interest in constructivity, but rather are designed for computer science applications where partial, not total, knowledge of machines states is all that is available, and where concurrency is allowed. Unlike previous constructive modal logics, diamond does not distribute over disjunction, and this feature is what makes the logics suitable to model concurrency. The semantics is Kripke models of "possible worlds" with a partial order on worlds for intuitionistic partial knowledge and a second arbitrary accessibility relation on the same worlds. A cut free sequent calculus is shown to be complete with respect to the proposed semantics, whereby interpolation theorems are obtained. The basic calculus is enriched to allow the modal accessibility to be between points and sets to cover intended applications to concurrency. Topological and algebraic models are deﬁned and shown to be complete. A constructivised version of sequential dynamic logic is introduced and then extended to incorporate concurrency.},

@phdthesis{Mendler1993,
abstract = {The application of formal methods to the design of correct computer hardware depends crucially on the use of abstraction mechanisms to partition the synthesis and verification task into tractable pieces. Unfortunately however, behavioural abstractions are genuine mathematical abstractions only up to behavioural constraints, i.e. under certain restrictions imposed on the device's environment. Timing constraints on input signals form an important class of such restrictions. Hardware components that behave properly only under such constraints satisfy their abstract specifications only approximately. This is an impediment to the naive approach to formal verification since the question of how to apply a theorem prover when one only knows approximately what formula to prove has not as yet been dealt with. In this thesis we propose, as a solution, to interpret the notion of `correctness up to constraint' as a modality of intuitionistic predicate logic so as to remove constraints from the specification and to make them part of its proof. This provides for an `approximate' verification of abstract specifications and yet does not compromise the rigour of the argument since a realizability semantics can be used to extract the constraints. Also, the abstract verification is separated from constraint analysis which in turn may be delayed arbitrarily. In the proposed framework constraint analysis comes down to proof analysis and a computational semantics on proofs may be used to manipulate and simplify constraints.},

abstract = {In 1989, Eugenio Moggi proposed a categorical framework for program semantics based on the notion of a strong monad. He showed that various kinds of computation can be modeled in his framework. On the other hand, strong monads are not suited for the categorical semantics of traditional modal logics. According to these observations, Moggi thought that the CurryHoward correspondence would not hold between programs and constructive proofs in modal logics. However, contrary to his view, we can show that proofs in a certain kind of modal logics are actually considered as programs. In this paper, first we shall introduce the notion of an ℓ-strong monad which is a generalization of strong monads. Using this new notion, we can generalize Moggi's semantics-preserving soundness and completeness with respect to his equational logic. Next we shall show that ℓ-strong monads give a sound and complete semantics of a constructive version of S4 modal logic. Finally, we present a method to extract a monad-based imperative functional program from a proof in the modal logic. Interestingly, this method can also be understood in terms of ℓ-strong monads.},

We discuss the needs and challenges for the design of a scalable quantum programming language. We then present two interesting approaches and examine their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we take a step back, and review the state of the research on the semantics of quantum computation, and how this can help in achieving some of the goals.},

We propose a natural notion of logical relations able to deal with the monadic types of Moggi's computational lambda-calculus. The treatment is categorical, and is based on notions of subsconing, mono factorization systems, and monad morphisms. Our approach has a number of interesting applications, including cases for lambda-calculi with non-determinism (where being in logical relation means being bisimilar), dynamic name creation, and probabilistic systems.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries have been made connecting abstract homotopy theory and the field of type theory from logic and theoretical computer science. This has given rise to a new field, which has been christened "homotopy type theory". In this direction, Vladimir Voevodsky observed that it is possible to model type theory using simplicial sets and that this model satisfies an additional property, called the Univalence Axiom, which has a number of striking consequences. He has subsequently advocated a program, which he calls univalent foundations, of developing mathematics in the setting of type theory with the Univalence Axiom and possibly other additional axioms motivated by the simplicial set model. Because type theory possesses good computational properties, this program can be carried out in a computer proof assistant. In this paper we give an introduction to homotopy type theory in Voevodsky's setting, paying attention to both theoretical and practical issues. In particular, the paper serves as an introduction to both the general ideas of homotopy type theory as well as to some of the concrete details of Voevodsky's work using the well-known proof assistant Coq. The paper is written for a general audience of mathematicians with basic knowledge of algebraic topology; the paper does not assume any preliminary knowledge of type theory, logic, or computer science.},

abstract = {We present a reconstruction of session types in a linear pi calculus where types are qualified as linear or unrestricted. Linearly qualified communication channels are guaranteed to occur in exactly one thread, possibly multiple times; unrestricted (or shared) channels may appear in an unbounded number of threads. In our language each channel is characterized by two distinct variables, one used for reading, the other for writing; scope restriction binds together two variables, thus establishing the correspondence between the two ends of the same channel. This mechanism allows a precise control of resources via a conventional linear type system. Furthermore, the uniform treatment of linear and shared channels leads to a surprisingly simply theory which, in addition, extends typability when compared to traditional systems for session types. We build the language gradually, starting from simple input/output, then adding recursive types, replication and finally choice. We also present an algorithmic type checking system. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Unbounded nondeterminism has played a fundamental role in the areas of refinement between models of languages supporting real-time constructs and in the treatment of fairness. Unlike bounded nondeterminism, unbounded nondeterminism has not been amenable to a satisfactory treatment using, for instance, the techniques of domain theory. In this paper we explore this issue, and we show that only one of the three powerdomains has a suitable analogue for modeling unbounded nondeterminism. In the process, we are forced to leave the realm of directed complete partial orders and continuous maps. The theory we develop is based on the theory first presented in [7], which itself was based on work on unbounded nondeterminism in untimed and Timed CSP. ?? 2000.},

abstract = {\nMixed computation is processing of an incomplete information. Its product are a partially processed information and a so-called residual program destined to complete in sequel the processing of the remaining information. Many kinds of practical work with programs are nothing more but obtaining a residual program. We demonstrate, as an example, the application of mixed computation to compilation. Under computational approach mixed computation generalizes the operational semantics of a language by inclusion of steps which generate residual program instructions. Under transformational approach the residual program is obtained as a result of a series of so-called basic transformations of the program text. We argue that the transformational approach is more fundamental, for it allows to describe mixed computation in all its variety and moreover, to relate mixed computation to other kinds of program manipulation: execution, optimization, macroprocessing, synthesis. Such an integrated approach leads us to a transformational machine concept.},

abstract = {Multi-level generating extensions, studied by Gl{\"{u}}ck and J{\o}rgensen, are generalization of (two-level) program generators, such as parser generators, to arbitrary many levels. By this generalization, the notion of persistent code---a quoted code fragment that can be used for different stages---naturally arises.In this paper we propose a typed $\lambda$ calculus $\lambda$ circle square, based on linear-time temporal logic, as a basis of programming languages for multi-level generating extensions with persistent code. The key idea of the type system is correspondence of (1) linearly ordered times in the logic to computation stages; (2) a formula circle A (next A) to a type of code that runs at the next stage; and (3) a formula circle A (always A) to a type of persistent code executable at and after the current stage. After formalizing ($\lambda$ circle square), we prove its key property of time-ordered normalization that a well-typed program can never go back to a previous stage in a "time-ordered" execution, as well as basic properties such as subject reduction, confluence and strong normalization. Commuting conversion plays an important role for time-ordered normalization to hold},

The classic completeness results of, e.g., Friedman and Plotkin are immediate consequences.

abstract = {Possible world semantics underlies many of the applications of modal logic in computer science and philosophy. The standard theory arises from interpreting the semantic definitions in the ordinary meta-theory of informal classical mathematics. If, however, the same semantic definitions are interpreted in an intuitionistic meta-theory then the induced modal logics no longer satisfy certain intuitionistically invalid principles. This thesis investigates the intuitionistic modal logics that arise in this way. Natural deduction systems for various intuitionistic modal logics are presented. From one point of view, these systems are self-justifying in that a possible world interpretation of the modalities can be read off directly from the inference rules. A technical justification is given by the faithfulness of translations into intuitionistic first-order logic. It is also established that, in many cases, the natural deduction systems induce well-known intuitionistic modal logics, previously given by Hilbert-style axiomatizations. The main benefit of the natural deduction systems over axiomatizations is their susceptibility to proof-theoretic techniques. Strong normalization (and confluence) results are proved for all of the systems. Normalization is then used to establish the completeness of cut-free sequent calculi for all of the systems, and decidability for some of the systems. Lastly, techniques developed throughout the thesis are used to establish that those intuitionistic modal logics proved decidable also satisfy the finite model property. For the logics considered, decidability and the finite model property presented open problems.},

@article{Jacob2008,
abstract = {Several semantic-based malware analyzers have recently been put forward, each one defining its own model to capture the code behavior. All these semantic models, and abstract virology models likewise, fundamentally rely on formalisms equivalent to Turing Machines. However, as stated by recent advances in computer theory, these same formalisms do not capture appropriately interactions and concurrency. Unfortunately, malware, adaptable and resilient by essence, are likely to use these mechanisms intensively. In this paper, we thus extend the malware models to the specifically designed Interaction Machines. We first introduce two formal definitions for the interactive and the distributed viruses. According to different classes of interactions, their detection complexity is strongly impacted. Based on interactive languages, we then design an operational framework to describe malicious behaviors. Descriptions for some representative behaviors are given to complete and assess this framework. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag France.},

This calculus aims at being the kernel for a type theory in which the user will be able to formalize logics or formal systems using the LF methodology, while taking advantage of new induction and recursion principles, extending the principles available in a calculus such as the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. The key idea of our system is the use of modal logic S4. We present here the system, its typing rules and reduction rules. The system enjoys the decidability of typability, soundness of typed reduction with respect to the typing rules, the Church–Rosser and strong normalization properties and it is a conservative extension over the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus. These properties entail the preservation of the adequacy of encodings.},

abstract = {We propose the design of a programming language for quantum computing. Traditionally, quantum algorithms are frequently expressed at the hardware level, for instance in terms of the quantum circuit model or quantum Turing machines. These approaches do not encourage structured programming or abstractions such as data types. In this paper, we describe the syntax and semantics of a simple quantum programming language with high-level features such as loops, recursive procedures, and structured data types. The language is functional in nature, statically typed, free of run-time errors, and has an interesting denotational semantics in terms of complete partial orders of superoperators.},

abstract = {We present a game semantics for Linear Logic, in which formulas denote games and proofs denote winning strategies. We show that our semantics yields a categorical model of Linear Logic and prove full completeness for Multiplicative Linear Logic with the MIX rule: every winning strategy is the denotation of a unique cut-free proof net. A key role is played by the notion of history-free strategy; strong connections are made between history-free strategies and the Geometry of Interaction. Our semantics incorporates a natural notion of polarity, leading to a refined treatment of the additives. We make comparisons with related work by Joyal, Blass, et al.

We finally give a constructive proof for the second fixed point theorem for the representation schema.

We show that the canonical utility maximisation is one special case of a quantifier and that our more abstract framework provides several additional degrees of freedom in modelling. In particular, incomplete preferences, non-maximising heuristics, and context-dependent motives can be taken into account when describing an agent's goal. We introduce a suitable generalisation of Nash equilibrium for games in terms of quantifiers and selection functions. Moreover, we introduce a refinement of Nash that captures context-dependency of goals. Modelling in our framework is compositional as the parts of the game are modular and can be easily exchanged. We provide an extended example where we illustrate concepts and highlight the benefits of our alternative modelling approach.},

In the same way that the Logic of Proofs internalises its own derivations, $\lambda$ I internalises its own computations. Confluence and strong normalisation of $\lambda$ I is proved.

abstract = {Reflection is a wide-ranging concept that has been studied independently in many different areas of science in general, and computer science in particular. Even in the sub-area of programming languages, it has been applied to different paradigms, especially the logic, functional and objectoriented ones. Partly because of different past influences, but also because researchers in these communities scarcely talk to each others, concepts have evolved separately, sometimes to the point where it is hard for people in one community to recognize similarities in the work of others, not to speak about cross-fertilization among them. In this paper, we propose a synthesis covering mainly the application of computation reflection to programming languages. We compare the different approaches and try to identify similar concepts hidden behind different names or constructs. We also point out the different emphasis that has been given to different concepts in each of them. We do not claim neither comp...},

@article{Cohen1985,
abstract = {In this thesis, we open the new topics of viruses and protection from viruses in computer systems. We define a class of computing mechanisms called "viruses",1 and explore many of their properties, particularly in regard to the threat they pose to the integrity of information in information systems. The present work concentrates, at the surface level, on integrity problems in computer systems, but strong analogies may be drawn to biological systems and other systems with the information characteristics necessary to support viruses. Where possible, analogies to other systems will be drawn at a philosophical level, but no attempt will be made to demonstrate these analogies with mathematical rigor. We begin our discussion by briefly reviewing the relevant literature in "computer security", and conclude that no serious previous work has been found in the open literature on the problem of computer viruses. It thus appears that the concept of computer viruses is a novelty in scientific literature at this point, and that little effective protection against viruses is currently available. We begin the discussion of viruses with an informal discussion based on an English language definition. We give "pseudo-program" examples of viruses as they might appear in modern computer systems, and use these examples to demonstrate some of the potential damage that could result from their use in attacking systems. It is because of this potential damage that we give our examples in pseudo-code rather than an actual computer language for an actual computer system. We formally define viruses for "Turing machines", and explore some of their properties. We define a Turing machine and a set of (machine,tape-set) pairs which comprise "viral sets" (VS). We show that the union of VSs is also a VS, and that therefor a "largest" VS (LVS) exists for any machine with a viral set. We define a "smallest" VS (SVS), as a VS of which no subset is a VS, and show that for any finite integer "i", there is an SVS with exactly i elements. We show that any self replicating tape sequence is a one element SVS, that there are countably infinite VSs and non VSs, that machines exist for which all tape sequence are viruses and for which no tape sequences are viruses, and that any finite sequence of tape symbols is a virus with respect to some machine. We show that determining whether a given (machine,tape-set) pair is a VS is undecidable (by reduction from the halting problem), that it is undecidable whether or not a given "virus" evolves into another virus, that any number that can be "computed" by a TM can be "evolved" by a virus, and that therefor, viruses are at least as powerful as Turing machines as a means for computation. We then move into a discussion of the relevance of viruses to modern computer protection techniques. We modify the "subject object" protection model @cite[Harrison] to allow computation to be modeled along with protection, by defining a new class of protection machines called "Universal Protection Machines" (UPMs). We show several examples of UPM viruses, and prove that a virus can spread to the transitive closure of information paths from any given source. The paths of sharing, transitivity of information flow, and generality of information interpretation are identified as the key properties in the spread of computer viruses, and a case by case analysis of these properties is shown. We show that the only systems with potential for limiting viral spreading are systems with limited transitivity and limited sharing, systems with no sharing, and systems without general interpretation of information (Turing capability). Only the first case appears to be of practical interest to current computer systems. Several protection techniques are explored for their effect on limiting viral spread in computer systems, and some previously unexposed properties of the combination of the "security" and "integrity" models are shown. Difficulties with "imprecise" protection schemes are presented, the most injurious being their tendency to move towards isolationism. These results are extended to the design of secure computer networks which implement distributed isolationism, and which allow the connection of trusted and untrusted computers to form trusted computer networks. Simple design rules are derived which allow the configuration of secure networks from pictures. Two classes of attacks against these types of computer networks are examined, and an example network is shown under various attack assumptions. We examine the generalization and combination of security and integrity lattices to partial orderings, and show that a partial ordering is as general a classification scheme as is necessary to model protection in a transitive information network. We extend the previous results to include the effects of modifications of a protection system over time, show techniques for generalized evaluation of the effects of collusions, and demonstrate a method by which a provably correct information management system for automating administration of protection in information networks may be implemented. We explore viral detection and removal methods which don't depend on the prevention of sharing, limitations on transitivity of information flow, or restricted functionality. Undecidability issues presented earlier are presented in a different form to demonstrate the potential difficulties with detection and cure of computer viruses. Although certain classes of viruses, predominantly those with trivial or simplistic evolutionary characteristics, appear to be defensible through detection and removal, more complex or highly evolutionary viruses appear to present unscalable barriers. The biological analogy to rapidly mutating viruses such as those which comprise the common cold appears to be very strong here. We examine a complexity based integrity maintenance method with the possibility of detecting corruption through built in self test. A method is shown whereby copyright notices and other aspects of programs and data may be maintained even in a system with no built in defenses. Integrity corruption in such a system is show to be extremely complex, and the technique appears to present a costly but viable defense. The results of several experiments with computer viruses are used to demonstrate that viruses are a formidable threat in both normal and high security operating systems. Detailed descriptions of experiments are given for three examples, an example of a very short virus for an actual operating system is given, and summary tables are presented. We explore the use of the results in computer viruses in biological and other domains, and consider the use of the fundamental viral definition as a definition of life. Living systems are considered as a combination of an environment and information within that environment which reproduces and evolves, and several philosophical questions are explored. It is concluded that the study of computer viruses is an important research area with potential applications to other fields, that current systems offer little or no protection from viral attack, and that the only perfectly 'safe' policy as of this time is isolationism. Extensions of this work are suggested, and several conjectures are presented.},

abstract = {In this dissertation we develop a new formal graphical framework for causal reasoning. Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions. ERRATA: (i) Pages 41-42: Objects of a causal theory are words, not collections, in $V$, and we include swaps as generating morphisms, subject to the identities defining a symmetric monoidal category. (ii) Page 46: A causal model is a strong symmetric monoidal functor.},

The proofs of soundness and completeness are constructive and the computational content of their composition is, in particular, a ??-normalisation-by-evaluation program for simply typed lambda calculus with sum types. Although the inspiration comes from Danvy's type-directed partial evaluator for the same lambda calculus, the use of delimited control operators (i.e. computational effects) is avoided. The role of polymorphism is crucial - dropping it allows one to obtain a notion of model complete for classical predicate logic. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, its applications to stateful or effectful languages, incorporating (co)models of a countable Lawvere theory, have been elusive so far. We make some progress towards a coalgebraic treatment of such languages, proposing a congruence format related to the evaluation-in-context paradigm. We formalise the denotational semantics in suitable Kleisli categories, and prove adequacy and compositionality of the semantic theory under this congruence format. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Farmer2013,
abstract = {It is often useful, if not necessary, to reason about the syntactic structure of an expression in an interpreted language (i.e., a language with a semantics). This paper introduces a mathematical structure called a syntax framework that is intended to be an abstract model of a system for reasoning about the syntax of an interpreted language. Like many concrete systems for reasoning about syntax, a syntax framework contains a mapping of expressions in the interpreted language to syntactic values that represent the syntactic structures of the expressions; a language for reasoning about the syntactic values; a mechanism called quotation to refer to the syntactic value of an expression; and a mechanism called evaluation to refer to the value of the expression represented by a syntactic value. A syntax framework provides a basis for integrating reasoning about the syntax of the expressions with reasoning about what the expressions mean. The notion of a syntax framework is used to discuss how quotation and evaluation can be built into a language and to define what quasiquotation is. Several examples of syntax frameworks are presented.},

abstract = {Most of malware detectors are based on syntactic signatures that identify known malicious programs. Up to now this architecture has been sufficiently efficient to overcome most of malware attacks. Nevertheless, the complexity of malicious codes still increase. As a result the time required to reverse engineer malicious programs and to forge new signatures is increasingly longer. This study proposes an efficient construction of a morphological malware detector, that is a detector which associates syntactic and semantic analysis. It aims at facilitating the task of malware analysts providing some abstraction on the signature representation which is based on control flow graphs. We build an efficient signature matching engine over tree automata techniques. Moreover we describe a generic graph rewriting engine in order to deal with classic mutations techniques. Finally, we provide a preliminary evaluation of the strategy detection carrying out experiments on a malware collection.},

annote = {3rd on metaprogramming by Moggi (1st = Idealized MetaML, 2nd = manuscript on categorical semantics of AIM).

Introduces Lambda BN, a FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION of AIM (Idealized MetaML).

Lambda BN = Davies Lambda Circle + Bierman/de Paiva S4 + safe_run.

Lambda BN is different in two ways: (a) the BOX construct is STRICT - evaluations can happen under it, and (b) it does NOT have full cross-stage persistence.

Cross-stage persistence is limited. The variable rule only allows using a variable at its current stage (and not in the far future, like in AIM). On the other hand, anything at time 0 which depends only on *closed* things at time 0 is available at any time n -- which is exactly like AIM.

The final difference is the RUN construct (here called safe_run). In MetaML, the run construct was unsafe. In AIM, the run construct was safe yet complicated, involving quite a few restrictions. It is simple and safe here. The table on page 11 lists all these systems together, for convenience. 

Includes categorical semantics.

AIM (An Idealized MetaML) is CONTAINED in Lambda BN.
Lambda Circle + Lambda Box are CONTAINED in Lambda BN.
MetaML is NOT CONTAINED in Lambda BN (no full cross-stage).},

It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new $\lambda$-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual $\lambda$-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.},

@article{Hofmann2004,
abstract = {Theories of dependent types have been proposed as a foundation of constructive mathematics and as a framework in which to construct certified programs. In these applications an important role is played by identity types which internalise equality and therefore are essential for accommodating proofs and programs in the same formal system.

This thesis attempts to reconcile the two different ways that type theories deal with identity types. In extensional type theory the propositional equality induced by the identity types is identified with definitional equality, i.e. conversion. This renders type-checking and well-formedness of propositions undecidable and leads to non-termination in the presence of universes. In intensional type theory propositional equality is coarser than definitional equality, the latter being confined to definitional expansion and normalisation. Then type-checking and well-formedness are decidable, and this variant is therefore adopted by most implementations.

However, the identity type in intensional type theory is not powerful enough for formalisation of mathematics and program development. Notably, it does not identify pointwise equal functions (functional extensionality) and provides no means of redefining equality on a type as a given relation, i.e. quotient types. We call such capabilities extensional concepts. Other extensional concepts of interest are uniqueness of proofs and more specifically of equality proofs, subset types, and propositional extensionality---the identification of equivalent propositions. In this work we investigate to what extent these extensional concepts may be added to intensional type theory without sacrificing decidability and existence of canonical forms. The method we use is the translation of identity types into equivalence relations defined by induction on the type structure. In this way type theory with extensional concepts can be understood as a high-level language for working with equivalence relations instead of equality. Such translations of type theory into itself turn out to be best described using categorical models of type theory.

We thus begin with a thorough treatment of categorical models with particular emphasis on the interpretation of type-theoretic syntax in such models. We then show how pairs of types and predicates can be organised into a model of type theory in which subset types are available and in which any two proofs of a proposition are equal. This model has applications in the areas of program extraction from proofs and modules for functional programs. For us its main purpose is to clarify the idea of syntactic translations via categorical model constructions.

The main result of the thesis consists of the construction of two models in which functional extensionality and quotient types are available. In the first one types are modelled by types together with proposition-valued partial equivalence relations. This model is rather simple and in addition provides subset types and propositional extensionality. However, it does not furnish proper dependent types such as vectors or matrices. We try to overcome this disadvantage by using another model based on families of type-valued equivalence relations which is however much more complicated and validates certain conversion rules only up to propositional equality.

We illustrate the use of these models by several small examples taken from both formalised mathematics and program development.

We also establish various syntactic properties of propositional equality including a proof of the undecidability of typing in extensional type theory and a correspondence between derivations in extensional type theory and terms in intensional type theory with extensional concepts added. Furthermore we settle affirmatively the hitherto open question of the independence of unicity of equality proofs in intensional type theory which implies that the addition of pattern matching to intensional type theory does not yield a conservative extension.},

abstract = {Higher-order abstract syntax is a central representation technique in logical frameworks which maps variables of the object language into variables of the meta-language. It leads to concise encodings, but is incompatible with functions defined by primitive recursion or proofs by induction. In this paper we propose an extension of the simply typed lambda-calculus with iteration and case constructs which preserves the adequacy of higher-order abstract syntax encodings. The well-known paradoxes are avoided through the use of a modal operator which obeys the laws of S4. In the resulting calculus many functions over higher-order representations can be expressed elegantly. Our central technical result, namely that our calculus is conservative over the simply typed lambda-calculus, is proved by a rather complex argument using logical relations. We view our system as an important first step towards allowing the methodology of LF to be employed effectively in systems based on induction principles such as ALF, Coq, or NuPrl, leading to a synthesis of currently incompatible paradigms. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {With few exceptions, macros have traditionally been viewed as operations on syntax trees or even on plain strings. This view makes macros seem ad hoc, and is at odds with two desirable features of contemporary typed functional languages: static typing and static scoping. At a deeper level, there is a need for a simple, usable semantics for macros. This paper argues that these problems can be addressed by formally viewing macros as multi-stage computations. This view eliminates the need for freshness conditions and tests on variable names, and provides a compositional interpretation that can serve as a basis for designing a sound type system for languages supporting macros, or even for compilation. To illustrate our approach, we develop and present MacroML, an extension of ML that supports inlining, recursive macros, and the definition of new binding constructs. The latter is subtle, and is the most novel addition in a statically typed setting. The semantics of a core subset of MacroML is given by an interpretation into MetaML, a statically-typed multi-stage programming language. It is then easy to show that MacroML is stage- and type-safe: macro expansion does not depend on runtime evaluation, and both stages do not "go wrong.},

Current malware detectors work by checking for "signatures," which attempt to capture (syntactic) characteristics of the machine-level byte sequence of the malware. This reliance on a syntactic approach makes such detectors vulnerable to code obfuscations, increasingly used by malware writers, that alter syntactic properties of the malware byte sequence without significantly affecting their execution behavior.This paper takes the position that the key to malware identification lies in their semantics. It proposes a semantics-based framework for reasoning about malware detectors and proving properties such as soundness and completeness of these detectors. Our approach uses a trace semantics to characterize the behaviors of malware as well as the program being checked for infection, and uses abstract interpretation to "hide" irrelevant aspects of these behaviors. As a concrete application of our approach, we show that the semantics-aware malware detector proposed by Christodorescu et al. is complete with respect to a number of common obfuscations used by malware writers.},

This language, which uses an augmented information-flow type system to prevent control-flow leakage, allows programs to be developed and tested using conventional means, then exported to a variety of secure cloud execution platforms, dramatically reducing the amount of specialized knowledge needed to write secure code.

abstract = {The theory of computability often called basic recursive function theory is usually motivated and developed using Church's thesis. It is shown that there is an alternative computability theory in which some of the basic results on unsolvability become more absolute. Results on completeness become simpler, and many of the central concepts become more abstract. In this approach computations are viewed as mathematical objects, and the major theorems in recursion theory may be classified according to which axioms about computation are needed to prove them. The theory is a typed theory of functions over the natural numbers, and there are unsolvable problems in this setting independent of the existence of indexings. The unsolvability results are interpreted to show that the partial function concept serves to distinguish between classical and constructive type theories},

abstract = {We generalize the adjoint logics of Benton and Wadler (1996) and Reed (2009) to allow multiple different adjunctions between the same categories. This provides insight into the structural proof theory of cohesive homotopy type theory, which integrates the synthetic homotopy theory of homotopy type theory with the synthetic topology of Lawvere's axiomatic cohesion. Reed's calculus is parametrized by a preorder of modes, where each mode determines a category, and there is an adjunction between categories that are related by the preorder. Here, we consider a logic parametrized by a 2-category of modes, where each mode represents a category, each mode morphism represents an adjunction, and each mode 2-morphism represents a morphism of adjunctions. For example, us-ing this, we can give a mode theory for an adjoint triple L M R by using two mode morphisms to generate two adjunctions between the same two categories, and then using mode 2-cells to identify the right adjoint of one with the left ad-joint of the other. Adding some additional structure to the mode 2-category gives an instance that is closely related to the rules for cohesive homotopy type theory in Shulman (2015). In this paper, we give a sequent calculus, show that identity and cut are admissible, and define an equational theory on proofs. We show that this syntax is sound and complete for pseudofunctors from the mode 2-category to the 2-category of categories, adjunctions, and adjunction morphisms. Finally, we investigate some constructions in the example mode theories discussed above.},

abstract = {Homotopy type theory is an extension of Martin-L{\"{o}}f type theory, based on a correspondence with homotopy theory and higher category theory. In homotopy type theory, the propositional equality type becomes proof-relevant, and corresponds to paths in a space. This allows for a new class of datatypes, called higher inductive types, which are specified by constructors not only for points but also for paths. In this paper, we consider a programming application of higher inductive types. Version control systems such as Darcs are based on the notion of patches - syntactic representations of edits to a repository. We show how patch theory can be developed in homotopy type theory. Our formulation separates formal theories of patches from their interpretation as edits to repositories. A patch theory is presented as a higher inductive type. Models of a patch theory are given by maps out of that type, which, being functors, automatically preserve the structure of patches. Several standard tools of homotopy theory come into play, demonstrating the use of these methods in a practical programming context.},

The kind of logics we deal with, such as Girard's linear logic, are resource sensitive and have their proof-theory intimately related to various monoidal (tensor) categories. The GoI interpretation of dynamics aims to develop an algebraic/geometric theory of invariants for information flow in networks of proofs, via feedback.

These results are proved first in the absence of symmetry in the monoidal structure, and then with this symmetry. The monoidal structure is also allowed to be given with finite products or finite coproducts. Monoidal comonads with finite products axiomatize a plausible notion of identity of deductions in a fragment of the modal logic S4.},

abstract = {The Curry-Howard isomorphism identifies proofs with typed &lambda;-calculus terms, and correspondingly identifies propositions with types. We show how this isomorphism can be extended to relate constructive temporal logic with binding-time analysis. In particular we show how to extend the Curry-Howard isomorphism to include the O (&ldquo;next&rdquo;) operator from linear-time temporal logic. This yields the simply typed &lambda;O-calculus which we prove to be equivalent to a multi-level binding-time analysis like those used in partial evaluation for functional programming languages. Further, we prove that normalization in &lambda;O can be done in an order corresponding to the times in the logic, which explains why &lambda;O is relevant to partial evaluation. We then extend &lambda;O to a small functional language, Mini-MLO, and give an operational semantics for it. Finally, we prove that this operational semantics correctly reflects the binding-times in the language, a theorem which is the functional programming analog of time-ordered normalization},

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach towards the detection of metamorphic computer viruses through the algebraic specification of an assembly language. Metamorphic computer viruses are computer viruses that apply a variety of syntax-mutating, behaviour-preserving metamorphoses to their code in order to defend themselves against static analysis based detection methods. An overview of these metamorphoses is given. Then, in order to identify behaviourally equivalent instruction sequences, the syntax and semantics of a subset of the IA-32 assembly language instruction set is specified formally using OBJ - an algebraic specification formalism and theorem prover based on order-sorted equational logic. The concepts of equivalence and semi-equivalence are given formally, and a means of proving equivalence from semi-equivalence is given. The OBJ specification is shown to be useful for proving the equivalence or semi-equivalence of IA-32 instruction sequences by applying reductions - sequences of equational rewrites in OBJ. These proof methods are then applied to fragments of two different metamorphic computer viruses, Win95/Bistro and Win9x.Zmorph.A, in order to prove their (semi-)equivalence. Finally, the application of these methods to the detection of metamorphic computer viruses in general is discussed. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag France 2006.},

The answer is negative, as there are distinct operational and denotational notions of totality. However, when two terms are each total in both senses then they are totally equivalent operationally i they are totally equivalent in the Scott model. Analysing further, we consider sequential and parallel versions of PCF and several models: Scott's model of continuous functions, Milner's fully abstract model of PCF and their e ective submodels. We investigate how totality di ers between these models. Some apparently rather di cult open problems arise, essentially concerning whether the sequential and parallel versions of PCF have the same expressive power, in the sense of total equivalence.},

E is based on, apart from such constructs as parallel composition and process creation, three pairs of communication primitives which use the notion of a session, a semantically atomic chain of communication actions which can interleave with other such chains freely, for high-level abstraction of interaction-based computing. The three primitives enable programmers to elegantly describe complex interactions among processes with a rigorous type discipline similar to ML [4]. The language is given formal operational semantics and a type inference system, regarding which we prove that if a program is well-typed in the typing system, it never causes run-time error due to type inconsistent communication patterns, offering a new foundation for type discipline in parallel programming languages.},

The later modality is used to ensure the productivity of recursive definitions in a modular, type based, way. Clock quantifiers are used for controlled elimination of the later modality and for encoding coinductive types using guarded recursive types. Key to the development of gDTT are novel type and term formers involving what we call 'delayed sub-stitutions'. These generalise the applicative functor rules for the later modality considered in earlier work, and are crucial for programming and proving with dependent types.

The types and terms are those of the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus, and the rewrites are expressions denoting sequences of $\beta$-reductions and $\eta$-expansions. An equational theory is imposed on the rewrites, based on 2-categorical justifications, and the word problem for this theory is solved by finding a canonical expression in each equivalence class. The canonical form of rewrites allows us to prove several properties of the calculus, including a strong form of confluence and a classification of the long-$\beta$$\eta$-normal forms in terms of their rewrites. Finally we use these properties as the basic definitions of a theory of categorical rewriting, and find that the expected relationships between confluence, strong normalisation and normal forms hold.},

@article{Russell2015,
abstract = {PERHAPS THE MOST enduring idea from the early days of AI is that of a declarative system reasoning over explicitly represented knowledge with a general inference engine. Such systems require a formal language to describe the real world; and the real world has things in it. For this rea son, classical AI adopted first-order logic—the mathe matics of objects and relations—as its foundation. The key benefit of first-order logic is its expressive power, which leads to concise—and hence learnable—models. For example, the rules of chess occupy 10 0 pages in first-order logic, 10 5 pages in propositional logic, and 10 38 pages in the language of finite automata. The power comes from separating predicates from their arguments and quantifying over those arguments: so one can write rules about On(p, c, x, y, t) (piece p of color c is on square x, y at move t) without filling in each specific value for c, p, x, y, and t. Modern AI research has addressed another important property of the real world—pervasive uncertainty about both its state and its dynamics—using probability theory. A key step was Pearl's devel opment of Bayesian networks, which provided the beginnings of a formal language for probability mod-els and enabled rapid progress in rea-soning, learning, vision, and language understanding. The expressive power of Bayes nets is, however, limited. They assume a fixed set of variables, each taking a value from a fixed range; thus, they are a propositional formal-ism, like Boolean circuits. The rules of chess and of many other domains are beyond them. What happened next, of course, is that classical AI researchers noticed the perva-sive uncertainty, while modern AI research-ers noticed, or remembered, that the world has things in it. Both traditions arrived at the same place: the world is uncertain and it has things in it. To deal with this, we have to unify logic and probability. But how? Even the meaning of such a goal is unclear. Early attempts by Leibniz, Bernoulli, De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, Keynes, and Carnap (surveyed by Hailperin 12},

@phdthesis{Licata2011a,
abstract = {This dissertation describes progress on programming with domain-specific specification logics in dependently typed programming languages. Domain-specific logics are a promising way to verify software, using a logic tailored to a style of programming or an application domain. Examples of domain-specific logics include separation logic, which has been used to verify imperative programs, and authorization logics, which have been used to verify security properties in security-typed languages. The first goal of the research described here is to show that it is possible to define, study, automate, and use domain-specific logics within a dependently typed programming language. We demonstrate this fact with a significant new example, showing how to embed a security-typed language using dependent types. This example suggests that better support for programming with logics in type theory will facilitate this style of program verification. The central notion in logic is consequence—entailment from premises to conclusions—and two notions of consequence are necessary for programming with logics: derivability, which captures uniform reasoning, and admissibility, which captures inductive proofs and functional programs. Presently, derivability is better supported in LF-based proof assistants, such as Twelf, Delphin, and Beluga, whereas admissibility is better supported in proof assistants based on Martin-L6f type theory, such as Coq, Agda, and Epigram. Our second contribution is to show that it is possible to implement, within a dependently typed programming language, a logical framework that allows derivability and admissibility to be mixed in novel and interesting ways. The above framework is simply-typed, which makes it suitable for programming with abstract syntax but not logical derivations. Our third contribution is to generalize this framework to dependent types, which we accomplish as an instance of a more general problem: We describe Directed Type Theory (DTT), a new notion of dependent type theory, inspired by higher-dimensional category theory, which equips each type with a notion of transformation on its elements. The structural properties of a logic arise as a special case, by considering a type of contexts equipped with an appropriate notion of transformation. DTT is an exciting development independently of our application, as it generalizes recent connections between type theory, homotopy theory, and category theory to the asymmetric case.},

@article{Davies2017,
abstract = {This article demonstrates that there is a fundamental relationship between temporal logic and languages that involve multiple stages, such as those used to analyze binding times in the context of partial evaluation. This relationship is based on an extension of the Curry-Howard isomorphism, which identifies proofs with programs, and propositions with types. Our extension involves the " next time " () operator from linear-time temporal logic and yields a $\lambda$-calculus $\lambda$ • with types of the form A for expressions in the subsequent stage, with appropriate introduction and elimination forms. We demonstrate that $\lambda$ • is equivalent to the core of a previously studied multilevel binding-time analysis. This is similar to work by Davies and Pfenning on staged computation based on the necessity (2) operator of modal logic, but 2 only allows closed code, and naturally supports a code evaluation construct, whereas captures open code, thus is more flexible, but is incompatible with such a construct. Instead, code evaluation is an external global operation that is validated by the proof theory regarding closed proofs of formulas. We demonstrate the relevance of $\lambda$ • to staged computation directly by showing that that normalization can be done in an order strictly following the times of the logic. We also extend $\lambda$ • to small functional language and show that it would serve as a suitable basis for directly programming with multiple stages by presenting some example programs.},

@book{Cox1961,
abstract = {In Algebra of Probable Inference, Richard T. Cox develops and demonstrates that probability theory is the only theory of inductive inference that abides by logical consistency. Cox does so through a functional derivation of probability theory as the unique extension of Boolean Algebra thereby establishing, for the first time, the legitimacy of probability theory as formalized by Laplace in the 18th century. Perhaps the most significant consequence of Cox's work is that probability represents a subjective degree of plausible belief relative to a particular system but is a theory that applies universally and objectively across any system making inferences based on an incomplete state of knowledge. Cox goes well beyond this amazing conceptual advancement, however, and begins to formulate a theory of logical questions through his consideration of systems of assertions—a theory that he more fully developed some years later. Although Cox's contributions to probability are acknowledged and have recently gained worldwide recognition, the significance of his work regarding logical questions is virtually unknown. The contributions of Richard Cox to logic and inductive reasoning may eventually be seen to be the most significant since Aristotle.},

@inproceedings{Curien2016,
abstract = {We consider the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence for effect- ful computation and resource management, specifically proposing polarised calculi together with presheaf-enriched adjunction mod- els as the starting point for a comprehensive semantic theory relat- ing logical systems, typed calculi, and categorical models in this context. Our thesis is that the combination of effects and resources should be considered orthogonally. Model theoretically, this leads to an understanding of our categorical models from two complementary perspectives: (i) as a linearisation of CBPV (Call-by-Push-Value) adjunction models, and (ii) as an extension of linear/non-linear ad- junction models with an adjoint resolution of computational effects. When the linear structure is cartesian and the resource structure is trivial we recover Levy's notion of CBPV adjunction model, while when the effect structure is trivial we have Benton's linear/non- linear adjunction models. Further instances of our model theory in- clude the dialogue categories with a resource modality of Melli{\`{e}}s and Tabareau, and the [E]EC ([Enriched] Effect Calculus) models of Egger, M{\o}gelberg and Simpson. Our development substantiates the approach by providing a lifting theorem of linear models into cartesian ones. To each of our categorical models we systematically associate a typed term calculus, each of which corresponds to a variant of the sequent calculi LJ (Intuitionistic Logic) or ILL (Intuitionistic Linear Logic). The adjoint resolution of effects corresponds to po- larisation whereby, syntactically, types locally determine a strict or lazy evaluation order and, semantically, the associativity of cuts is relaxed. In particular, our results show that polarisation provides a computational interpretation of CBPV in direct style. Further, we characterise depolarised models: those where the cut is associative, and where the evaluation order is unimportant.We explain possible advantages of this style of calculi for the operational semantics of effects},

abstract = {New viruses spread faster than ever and current signature based detection do not protect against these unknown viruses. Behavior\n based detection is the currently preferred defense against unknown viruses. The drawback of behavior based detection is the\n ability only to detect specific classes of viruses or have successful detection under certain conditions plus false positives.\n This paper presents a characterization of virus replication which is the only virus characteristic guaranteed to be consistently\n present in all viruses. Two detection models based on virus replication are developed, one using operation sequence matching\n and the other using frequency measures. Regression analysis was generated for both models. A safe list is used to minimize\n false positives. In our testing using operation sequence matching, over 250 viruses were detected with 43 subsequences. There\n were minimal false negatives. The replication sequence of just one virus detected 130 viruses, 45% of all tested viruses.\n Our testing using frequency measures detected all test viruses with no false negatives. The paper shows that virus replication\n can be identified and used to detect known and unknown viruses.},

abstract = {We study Girard's linear logic from the point of view of giving a concrete computational interpretation of the logic, based on the Curry—Howard isomorphism. In the case of Intuitionistic linear logic, this leads to a refinement of the lambda calculus, giving finer control over order of evaluation and storage allocation, while maintaining the logical content of programs as proofs, and computation as cut-elimination. In the classical case, it leads to a concurrent process paradigm with an operational semantics in the style of Berry and Boudol's chemical abstract machine. This opens up a promising new approach to the parallel implementation of functional programming languages; and offers the prospect of typed concurrent programming in which correctness is guaranteed by the typing.},

The resulting calculus is a typed reconstruction of name passing process calculi. Systems with both the explicit and implicit typing disciplines, where types form a simple hierarchy of types, are presented, which are proved to be in accordance with each other. A typed variant of bisimilarlty is formulated and it is shown that typed fl-equality has a clean embedding in the bisimUarity. Name reference structure induced by the simple hierarchy of types is studied, which fully characterises the typable terms in the set of untyped terms. It turns out that the name reference structure results in the deadlock-free property for a subset of terms with a certain regular structure, showing behavioural significance of the simple type discipline.},

abstract = {Theorem-proving on the computer, using procedures based on the fundamental theorem of Herbrand concerning the first-order predicate calculus, is examined with a view towards improving the efficiency and widening the range of practical applicability of these procedures. A close analysis of the process of substitution (of terms for variables), and the process of truth-functional analysis of the results of such substitutions, reveals that both processes can be combined into a single new process (called resolution), iterating which is vastly more efficient than the older cyclic procedures consisting of substitution stages alternating with truth-functional analysis stages. The theory of the resolution process is presented in the form of a system of first-order logic with just one inference principle (the resolution principle). The completeness of the system is proved; the simplest proof-procedure based on the system is then the direct implementation of the proof of completeness. However, this procedure is quite inefficient, and the paper concludes with a discussion of several principles (called search principles) which are applicable to the design of efficient proof-procedures employing resolution as the basic logical process.},

abstract = {Computer viruses are programs that can replicate themselves by infecting other programs in a system. Bonfante, Kaczmarek and Marion have recently proposed a classification of viruses which relies on the recursion theory and its recursion theorems. We propose an extension of their formalism to consider in a more practical way the mutation of viruses. In particular, we are interested in modelling any depth of mutation, not just the first two levels. We show that this formalism still relies on recursion theorems, whatever the depth of mutation, even in the case of infinite depth. We also extend furthermore this formalism to model the viability of viral replication, which ensures that an infected program still can propagate the virus. An application of the proposed formalism to the class of combined viruses (multi-part viruses) is studied. Finally, given that metamorphic viruses can be modelled by grammars operating on grammars, we study a recursion-based approach of formal grammars and show that the recursion theorems of the recursion theory can be ported to the formal grammars theory. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag France 2008.},

Whereas the Second Recursion Theorem (SRT) is applicable in a first-order setting, the First Recursion Theorem (FRT) requires a higher-order setting. In some cases both theorems are applicable, but one is stronger than the other: the FRT always produces least fixed points, but this is not always the case with the SRT. Nevertheless, an old result by Rogers allows us to bridge this gap by subtly redefining the implementation of a higher-order functional in order to bring it to a `standard form.'},

We use this kit to provide a term language for a presentation of LK (with conjunction, disjunction, and negation), and to transcribe cut elimination as (non confluent) rewriting. A key slogan here, which may appear here in print for the first time, is that commutative cut elimination rules are explicit substitution propagation rules. We then describe the focalised proof search discipline (in the classical setting), and narrow down the language and the rewriting rules to a confluent calculus (a variant of the second author's focalising system L). We then define a game of patterns and counterpatterns, leading us to a fully focalised finitary syntax for a synthetic presentation of classical logic, that provides a quotient on (focalised) proofs, abstracting out the order of decomposition of negative connectives.},

The coverage is by no means comprehensive, but should provide a good basis for further study; a guide to further reading is included. The main prerequisite is a basic familiarity with the elements of discrete mathematics: sets, relations and functions. An Appendix contains a summary of what we will need, and it may be useful to review this first. In addition, some prior exposure to abstract algebra - vector spaces and linear maps, or groups and group homomorphisms - would be helpful.},

@article{Burrell2014,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to prove that the initial Pola setting, with both inductive and coinductive data, is sound for polynomial size (PSIZE). Explicitly this means all programs written in Pola have their output size bounded by a polynomial in their input size. The paper describes the polarized categorical semantics for Pola and establishes the result by providing categorical models for various fragments of Pola which have explicit size bound information built into the maps. To obtain PSIZE soundness for Pola with just inductive data, the semantics in sized sets suffices. Sized sets are sets equipped with a "size map" which associates to each element a size. Size is usually just a natural number but, more generally, the size could be an element of a size rig. A polarized category consists of an opponent and a player category joined by a module. Sized sets can be used to create a polarized category by letting the opponent and module maps be bounded by polynomials while the player category consists of maps bounded by a constant. This gives a Pola setting with inductive data and immediately establishes the PSIZE soundness of the initial Pola setting. The main technical difficulty of the paper is to provide a semantics which correctly models coinductive data as well. For this "amortized" sets are introduced: these are set in which a higher-order size function is associated to each element, which given a size returns a size. This is amortized as one is concerned with the asymptotic behavior of these functions. While amortized sets have coinductive data they are not affine closed: a final step, using equivalence relations, is required to obtain a model which includes this aspect of Pola structure. While PSIZE by itself is a very weak bound it is a crucial step in establishing polynomial space (PSPACE) and polynomial time (PTIME) bounds for these settings. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

It will be extended with recursion, and the resulting functional programming language will be given operational as well as categorical semantics. The two semantics will be related by soundness and adequacy results. The main features of the categorical semantics are that convergence/divergence behaviour is modelled by a strong monad, and that recursion is modelled by ``linear fixpoints'' induced by CPO structure on the hom-sets. The ``linear fixpoints'' correspond to ordinary fixpoints in the category of free coalgebras w.r.t. the comonad used to interpret the ``of course'' modality. Concrete categories from (stable) domain theory satisfying the axioms of the categorical model are given, and thus adequacy follows in these instances from the general result.},

In other words, in this model a type in a nested sequence of identity types can contain more than one element, no matter how great the degree of nesting. Although inspired by existing non-truncated models of type theory based on simplicial and on cubical sets, the notion of model presented here is notable for avoiding any form of Kan filling condition in the semantics of types.},

abstract = {We define the complete Taylor expansion of an ordinary lambda-term as an infinite linear combination-with rational coefficients-of terms of a resource calculus similar to Boudol's lambda-calculus with multiplicities (or with resources). In our resource calculus, all applications are (multi)linear in the algebraic sense, i.e. commute with linear combinations of the function or the argument. We study the collective behaviour of the beta-reducts of the terms occurring in the Taylor expansion of any ordinary lambda-term, using, in a surprisingly crucial way, a uniformity property that they enjoy. As a corollary, we obtain (the main part of) a proof that this Taylor expansion commutes with B??hm tree computation, syntactically. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes and develops the basic theory for a new approach to typing multi-stage languages based a notion of environment classifiers. This approach involves explicit but lightweight tracking - at type-checking time - of the origination environment for future-stage computations. Classification is less restrictive than the previously proposed notions of closedness, and allows for both a more expressive typing of the "run" construct and for a unifying account of typed multi-stage programmin.The proposed approach to typing requires making cross-stage persistence (CSP) explicit in the language. At the same time, it offers concrete new insights into the notion of levels and in turn into CSP itself. Type safety is established in the simply-typed setting. As a first step toward introducing classifiers to the Hindley-Milner setting, we propose an approach to integrating the two, and prove type preservation in this setting.},

Computation thereby became starkly formal. The present paper takes steps toward developing a certain semantics to flesh out the formal bones of those computations. The old types 0,1,2 are represented within new types {black small square} where type 0 = {u, 0, 1,2,...} (u = "undefined" or "unknown"), and the higher types are composed of the "unimonotone" partial one-place functions from the preceding type into {0,1,2,...}. These are the functions which are monotone and can each be embodied in an oracle who, e.g. at type 2, has been programmed by Apollo to respond (if she does), to any question "{black small square}2({black small square}1)?" we ask, on the basis of information about {black small square}1 which she obtains by asking in turn questions of an oracle embodying {black small square}1 and observing her responses. ?? 1980 North-Holland Publishing Company.},

abstract = {We show how to derive natural deduction systems for the necessity fragment of various constructive modal logics by exploiting a pattern found in sequent calculi. The resulting systems are dual-context systems, in the style pioneered by Girard, Barber, Plotkin, Pfenning, Davies, and others. This amounts to a full extension of the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence to the necessity fragments of a constructive variant of the modal logics \textsf{K}, \textsf{K4}, \textsf{GL}, \textsf{T}, and \textsf{S4}. We investigate the metatheory of these calculi, as well as their categorical semantics. Finally, we speculate on their computational interpretation.},

abstract = {A meta-program is a program that generates or manipulates another program; in homogeneous meta-programming, a program may generate new parts of, or manipulate, itself. Meta-programming has been used extensively since macros were introduced to Lisp, yet we have little idea how formally to reason about meta-programs. This paper provides the first program logics for homogeneous meta-programming - using a variant of MiniML by Davies and Pfenning as underlying meta-programming language. We show the applicability of our approach by reasoning about example meta-programs from the literature. We also demonstrate that our logics are relatively complete in the sense of Cook, enable the inductive derivation of characteristic formulae, and exactly capture the observational properties induced by the operational semantics.},

abstract = {We develop the operational semantics of a probabilistic lambda-calculus with continuous distributions, as a foundation for universal probabilistic programming languages such as Church, Anglican, and Venture. Our first contribution is to adapt the classic operational semantics of lambda-calculus to the continuous case, via creating a measure space on terms and defining step-indexed approximations. We prove equivalence of big-step and small-step formulations of this distributional semantics. Our second contribution is to formalize the implementation technique of trace MCMC for our calculus and to show correctness. A key step is defining a sampling semantics of a term as a function from a trace of random samples to a value, and showing that the distribution induced by integrating over all traces equals the distributional semantics. Another step is defining sufficient conditions for the distribution induced by trace MCMC to converge to the distributional semantics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous correctness proof for trace MCMC for a higher-order functional language.},

abstract = {We introduce basic language constructs and a type discipline as a foun-dation of structured communication-based concurrent programming. The constructs, which are easily translatable into the summation-less asynchronous $\pi$-calculus, allow programmers to organise programs as a combination of multiple flows of (possibly unbounded) reciprocal interactions in a simple and elegant way, subsuming the pre-ceding communication primitives such as method invocation and rendez-vous. The resulting syntactic structure is exploited by a type disciplin{\`{e}} a la ML, which offers a high-level type abstraction of interactive behaviours of programs as well as guar-anteeing the compatibility of interaction patterns between processes in a well-typed program. After presenting the formal semantics, the use of language constructs is illustrated through examples, and the basic syntactic results of the type discipline are established. Implementation concerns are also addressed.},

@article{Hakli2012,
abstract = {Various sources in the literature claim that the deduction theorem does not hold for normal modal or epistemic logic, whereas others present versions of the deduction theorem for several normal modal systems. It is shown here that the apparent problem arises from an objectionable notion of derivability from assumptions in an axiomatic system. When a traditional Hilbert-type system of axiomatic logic is generalized into a system for derivations from assumptions, the necessitation rule has to be modified in a way that restricts its use to cases in which the premiss does not depend on assumptions. This restriction is entirely analogous to the restriction of the rule of universal generalization of first-order logic. A necessitation rule with this restriction permits a proof of the deduction theorem in its usual formulation. Other suggestions presented in the literature to deal with the problem are reviewed, and the present solution is argued to be preferable to the other alternatives. A contraction- and cut-free sequent calculus equivalent to the Hilbert system for basic modal logic shows the standard failure argument untenable by proving the underivability of MA from A.},

For the branching Wiener process, our results sharpen Chen's by relaxing the second moment condition used by Chen to a moment condition of the form $ \E X (\ln^+X )^{1+\lambda}< \infty$. In the rate functions that we find for a branching random walk, we figure out some new terms which didn't appear in Chen's work.The results are established in the more general framework, i.e. for a branching random walk with a random environment in time.The lack of the second moment condition for the offspring distribution and the fact that the exponential moment does not exist necessarily for the displacements make the proof delicate; the difficulty is overcome by a careful analysis of martingale convergence using a truncating argument. The analysis is significantly more awkward due to the appearance of the random environment.},

abstract = {Formal languages for probabilistic modeling enable re-use, modularity, and descriptive clarity, and can foster generic inference techniques. We introduce Church, a universal language for describing stochastic generative processes. Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset. The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories. Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models. We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite PCFGs, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models. Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques. 1},

While the theory of identity types was originally intended to internalize the notion of equality in type theory, and thereby enableing one to prove equality of two terms by inhabiting the corresponding identity types, it has become apparent in the last decade that it provides a setting for doing formal homotopy theory. The main idea was to interpret a proof of equality for two terms a and b as a path from a to b. The pioneers of this interpretation were Steve Awodey, Michael Warren and Vladimir Voevodsky and the theory that resulted from their work is currently intensively investigated, both from it's type theoretical side and by providing new models for the theory.

Session types describe the input/output behavior of processes and traditionally provide strong guarantees about this behavior (i.e., deadlock freedom and fidelity). While these systems exploit a fundamental notion of linearity, the precise connection between linear logic and session types has not been well understood. This paper proposes a type system for the $\pi$-calculus that corresponds to a standard sequent calculus presentation of intuitionistic linear logic, interpreting linear propositions as session types and thus providing a purely logical account of all key features and properties of session types. We show the deep correspondence between linear logic and session types by exhibiting a tight operational correspondence between cut elimination steps and process reductions. We also discuss an alternative presentation of linear session types based on classical linear logic, and compare our development with other more traditional session type systems.},

@article{Nanevski2002,
abstract = {Meta-programming languages provide infrastructure to generate and execute object programs at run-time. In a typed setting, they contain a modal type constructor which classifies object code. These code types generally come in two flavors: closed and open. Closed code expressions can be invoked at run-time, but the computations over them are more rigid, and typically produce less efficient residual object programs. Open code provides better inlining and partial evaluation of object programs, but once constructed, expressions of this type cannot in general be evaluated.Recent work in this area has focused on combining the two notions into a sound system. We present a novel way to achieve this. It is based on adding the notion of names from the work on Nominal Logic and FreshML to the $\lambda$ -calculus of proof terms for the necessity fragment of modal logic S4. The resulting language provides a more fine-grained control over free variables of object programs when compared to the existing languages for meta-programming. In addition, this approach lends itself well to addition of intensional code analysis, i.e. ability of meta programs to inspect and destruct object programs at run-time in a type-safe manner, which we also undertake.},

@unpublished{Licata2017a,
abstract = {Many intuitionistic substructural and modal logics / type theories can be seen as a restriction on the allowed proofs in a standard structural logic / $\lambda$ -calculus. For example, substructural logics remove properties such as associativity, weakening, exchange, and contraction, while modal logics place restrictions on the positions in which certain vari-ables can be used. These restrictions are usually enforced by a specific context structure (trees,lists,multisets,sets,dual zones,...) that products, implications, and modalities manipulate. While the general technique is clear, it can be dif-ficult to devise rules modeling a new situation, a problem we have recently run into while extending homotopy type theory to express additional mathematical applications. In this paper, we define a general framework that abstracts the common features of many intuitionistic substruc-tural and modal logics. The framework is a sequent calculus / normal-form type theory parametrized by a mode theory, which is used to describe the structure of contexts and the structural properties they obey. The framework makes use of resource annotations, where we pair the context itself, which obeys standard structural properties, with a term, drawn from the mode theory, that constrains how the context can be used. Product types, implications, and modalities are defined as instances of two general connectives, one positive and one negative, that manipulate these resource annotations. We show that specific mode theories can express non-associative, ordered, linear, affine, rel-evant, and cartesian products and implications; monoidal and non-monoidal comonads and adjunctions; strong and non-strong monads; n-linear variables; bunched implications; and the adjunctions that arose in our work on homotopy type theory. We prove cut (and identity) admissibility independently of the mode theory, obtaining it for all of the above logics at once. Further, we give a general equational theory on derivations / terms that, in addition to the usual $\beta$ $\eta$-rules, characterizes when two derivations differ only by the placement of structural rules. Finally, we give an equivalent semantic presentation of these ideas, in which a mode theory corresponds to a 2-dimensional cartesian multicategory, and the framework corresponds to another such multicategory with a functor to the mode theory. The logical connectives have universal properties relative to this functor, making it into a bifibration. The sequent calculus rules and the equational theory on derivations are sound and complete for this. The resulting framework can be used both to understand existing logics / type theories and to design new ones.},

General elimination rules are motivated through an inversion principle, the dual form of which gives the general introduction rules. By restricting all the rules to their single-succedent versions, a uniform calculus for intuitionistic linear logic is obtained. The calculus encompasses both natural deduction and sequent calculus that are obtained as special instances from the uniform calculus. Other instances give all the invertibilities and partial invertibilities for the sequent calculus rules of linear logic. The calculus is normalizing and satisfies the subformula property for normal derivations.},

A tenth section discussing the relations between mathematical logic and computation has been added. Programs that learn to modify their own behaviors require a way of representing algorithms so that interesting properties and interesting transformations of algorithms are simply represented. Theories of computability have been based on Turing machines, recursive factions of integers and computer programs. Each of these has artificialities which make it difficult to manipulate algorithms or to prove things about them. The present paper presents a formalism based on conditional forms and recursive functions whereby the functions computable in terms of certain base functions can be simply expressed. We also describe some of the formal properties of conditional forms and a method called recursion induction for proving facts about algorithms. A final section in the relations between computation and mathematical logic is included.},

Types are equipped with a constructor that describes the two ends of a single communication channel, this being the only type available for describing the behaviour of channels. Session types, in turn, describe the behaviour of each individual channel end, as usual. A novel notion of typing context split allows for typing processes not typable with extant type systems. We show that our system guarantees that typed processes do not engage in races for linear resources. We assess the expressiveness of the type system by providing three distinct encodings – from the pi calculus with polarized variables, from the pi calculus with accept and request primitives, and from the linear pi calculus – into our system. For each language we present operational and typing correspondences, showing that our system effectively subsumes foregoing works on linear and session types. In the case of the linear pi calculus we also provide a completeness result.},

@article{Futamura1999,
abstract = {This paper reports the relationship between formal description of semantics (i.e., intepreter) of a programming language and an actual compiler. The paper also describes a method to automatically generate an actual compiler froma a formal description which is, in some sense, the partial evaluation of a computation process. The compiler-compiler inspired by this method differs from conventional ones in that the compiler-compiler based on our method can describe an evaluation procedure (interpreter) in defining the semantics of a programming language, while the conventional one describes a translation process.},

@article{Melham2013,
abstract = {This paper explores the semantics of a combinatory fragment of reFLect, the lambda-calculus underlying a functional language used by Intel Corporation for hardware design and verification. ReFLect is similar to ML, but has a primitive data type whose elements are the abstract syntax trees of reFLect expressions themselves. Following the LCF paradigm, this is intended to serve as the object language of a higher-order logic theorem prover for specification and reasoning - but one in which object- and meta-languages are unified. The aim is to intermix program evaluation and logical deduction through reflection mechanisms. We identify some difficulties with the semantics of reFLect as currently defined, and propose a minimal modification of the type system that avoids these problems.},

@article{Filinski2001,
abstract = {We show how a simple semantic characterization of normalization by evaluation for the $\lambda$$\beta$$\eta$-calculus can be extended to a similar construction for normalization of terms in the computational $\lambda$-calculus. Specifically, we show that a suitable residualizing interpretation of base types, constants, and computational effects allows us to extract a syntactic normal form from a term's denotation. The required interpretation can itself be constructed as the meaning of a suitable functional program in an ML-like language, leading directly to a practical normalization algorithm. The results extend easily to product and sum types, and can be seen as a formal basis for call-by-value type-directed partial evaluation.},
